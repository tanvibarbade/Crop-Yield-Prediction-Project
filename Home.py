    ### Problem Statement  
    The problem at hand is predicting the *crop yield (kg per hectare)* based on various factors, such as:  
    - ðŸŒ± *Soil quality*  
    - ðŸŒ¾ *Seed variety*  
    - ðŸ§ª *Fertilizer usage*  
    - ðŸŒž *Weather conditions* (sunny days and rainfall)  
    - ðŸ’§ *Irrigation practices*  

    The goal is to understand how each feature influences the crop yield and make accurate predictions based on these features.

    ### Objective of the Model  

    - ðŸŽ¯ The primary objective is to predict the *crop yield (kg per hectare)* based on input features.  
    - ðŸ”§ By analyzing the impact of factors like soil quality, fertilizer usage, and irrigation schedules, the model aims to help *optimize farming practices* for better yields.  
    - ðŸ§  Provide insights to farmers and agricultural planners on how to adjust factors such as fertilizer amounts or irrigation schedules based on *expected weather conditions and soil quality*.  
    - ðŸ“Š Help farmers plan their resources effectively by predicting yields under varying conditions.
